# Waydroid Plymouth Boot

This is a simple plymouth theme for Waydroid-Linux

To install and test, clone the repo, and cd into the 'waydroid-plymouth' directory, then:

	./install

That will copy the files needed, then update alternatives. When it asks, just select the number option that shows as "waydroid-plymouth"

To just test:

	./preview.sh
